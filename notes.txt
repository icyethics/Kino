Features to add:
- Snack Bag (card area to keep confections in)
- Quests (For Oppenheimer, Zodiac, Bucket List)
- 

Jokers not triggering as intended:
I, Robot


Things that crash the game:
- Using cybertron at 0 cards used.
- Blade crashes if there's no vampire joker next to it

Bug Fixes/Patches:

- Jokers that destroy playing cards no longer leave ghost cards in deck
- Batman (1989) now properly increments
- Benjamin Button no longer changes the visuals of the card pre-scoring
- Gum, Cookie and Candy confection disabled because of run-ending bug
- Stand by me no longer crashes the game
- E.T. no longer crashes the game
- Mr. And Mrs. Smith now properly retriggers played cards
- LV426 no longer crashes the game when bought in a pack
- Cybertron no longer crashes the game when bought in a pack while no sci-fi cards have been used.


Balance Changes:
- Batman (1989) changed from +3 to +1
- Scaling hand-type jokers no longer double after defeating a boss blind, but just increment gains.

Balance Notes:
Demonic cards are too strong as a gain in the final ante (maybe they give x0.25 for each non-demonic card scored with them)
Suit chip cards are too strong for Common
- Wicker Man should be uncommon

Each movie joker should have a movie joker field with the following info:
kino_joker = {
    id = [tmdb id],
    budget = num in thousands
    box_office = num in thousands
    release_date = "year-month-day"

    critic_score = Rotten_tomatoes_score
    audience_score = TMDB score
    directors = {ID, ID, ID}
    Cast = {ID, ID, ID, ID}
}
