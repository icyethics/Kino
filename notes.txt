Bug Fixes/Patches:

- Batman (1989) now properly increments
- Benjamin Button no longer changes the visuals of the card pre-scoring
- Gum, Cookie and Candy confection disabled because of run-ending bug
- Stand by me no longer crashes the game
- E.T. no longer crashes the game

Balance Changes:
- Batman (1989) changed from +3 to +1
- Scaling hand-type jokers no longer double after defeating a boss blind, but just increment gains.

Balance Notes:
Demonic cards are too strong as a gain in the final ante (maybe they give x0.25 for each non-demonic card scored with them)
Suit chip cards are too strong for Common
- Wicker Man should be uncommon
