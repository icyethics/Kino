Balatro Goes Kino is a mod made to turn a game for poker nerds into a game for poker and movie nerds. It's main content is a large set of jokers inspired by movies, as well as new Enhancements and Tarot cards, with plans for boss blinds, challenges and decks.

### Current Content
- **90+ New Jokers**:  From hits like Titanic, E.T. and Iron Man to unnotable and unremarkable flops like The Three Musketeers (2011) and Krazy House. With many more jokers planned.
- **3 Enhancement:** Introducing Sci-fi, Demonic Cards and Romance cards!
- **4 Genre boosters:** New joker boosters, containing only jokers of the given genre.
- **6 New Planets:** 6 strange new worlds from the silver screen.
- **New Consumable: Confections!** Popcorn, soda and cookies. Items to nourish your run and give them a little boost.

### Planned Content

- *A lot of additional jokers.*
On streaming soon: Singing in the Rain, Jaws, and The Avengers

- *A bunch of new Enhancements.*
Horror cards, Fantasy cards, Mystery cards and Gangster cards, all coming up.

- *More boosters.*
Probably should get the other big genres in there, huh?

- *Real dumb film nerd mechanics.*
Get ready for jokers to get bonuses when they all share an actor, or the Kevin Bacon sticker, debuffing jokers if you don't own another joker that shares them.

- *Genre & Director decks.*
Increase the chances of associated jokers showing up, and start with a joker of that genre, or by that director.

### FAQ:
*Is this mod balanced?*
Not yet, at least. I've not focused on balancing yet at all. Feedback on balancing is encouraged and welcomed!

*I found a bug, what do I do?*
Please let me know by opening a discussion here, or posting in the Balatro Goes Kino thread on the official Balatro discord.
